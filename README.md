## Project Description
This is the final repository for "Tools for Analytics: Python" project, where we analyze yellow taxi and Uber trip data from 2009-2015, along with past weather data. We begin by loading and cleaning each dataset, and creating a SQLite database for each. Next, we use queries and visualizations to answer several statistical questions. The project is divided into four parts, namely data processing, data storage, data analysis, and data visualization.
